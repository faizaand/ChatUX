## What is this?
Right now, there's no unified design language for Bukkit plugins. And for many people, this
is a problem. A lot of developers just don't have time to develop streamlined chat user
experiences into their plugins, because they're focused on the more important stuff: the 
actual functionality of the plugin. But, while I sympathize with their plight, I would 
argue that the user experience is just as important.

ChatUX aims to provide a streamlined, simple-to-implement chat user experience API that
makes ordinarily non-trivial features - semantic colors, click buttons, and localization -
easily accessible for any developer to implement into his or her plugin.

## How do I use it?
This project is currently a heavy work-in-progress, so star this repo check back later!

## Who's behind it?
It's me, Faizaan Datoo.
